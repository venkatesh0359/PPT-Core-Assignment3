What is the final class in Java?

In Java, the final keyword is used to restrict the inheritance of a class or to prevent a class from being subclassed. When a class is declared as final, it means that no other class can extend it. Additionally, final can be applied to variables and methods to achieve different effects:


Final Class: A final class cannot be subclassed. It is often used when a class has been fully implemented, and the developer wants to ensure that it remains unchanged and cannot be extended.

final class MyFinalClass {
    // Class implementation
}

Final Method: A final method cannot be overridden by subclasses. It is useful when a method's implementation is considered critical and should not be modified by any subclasses.
class MyClass {
    final void myFinalMethod() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}

Final Variable: A final variable, once assigned a value, cannot be changed or reassigned. It acts as a constant and is often used for values that should not be modified.
java
class MyClass {
    final int MY_CONSTANT = 10;
}
