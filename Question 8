Q)What are the advantages of abstraction in Java?

A) Abstraction is an essential concept in object-oriented programming that allows you to hide the implementation details of an object and show only the relevant features to the outside world. The advantages of abstraction in Java are as follows:

Simplicity and Manageability: Abstraction simplifies the complexity of a system by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable units. This makes it easier to understand, design, and maintain the codebase.

Code Reusability: By providing a clear and standardized interface, abstraction allows classes and methods to be reused in different parts of the application without concern for their internal implementation.

Security: Abstraction allows you to hide sensitive details and only expose necessary functionality through interfaces. This enhances security by restricting access to critical components.

Flexibility and Extensibility: As long as the external interface remains unchanged, the internal implementation can be modified, extended, or replaced without affecting other parts of the code that rely on the abstraction.

Reduced Dependencies: Abstraction reduces the dependency between components, enabling more modular and loosely coupled designs. This makes it easier to make changes to individual components without affecting the entire system.

Focus on What, Not How: Abstraction allows developers to focus on "what" needs to be done rather than "how" it is done. This high-level perspective promotes better design decisions and higher-level thinking.
